It is possible to choose your own anchor, instead of using the default '@'
character. The anchor does not have to be a single charater, it may also be
longer, like '(-:'.

Please do pick your anchor carefully. Some characters may not work (like letters
or numbers). If you think you found an anchor that is not working while it
should. Please let me know!
